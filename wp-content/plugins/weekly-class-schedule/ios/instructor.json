{"1":{"instructor_name":"Wile E. Coyote","instructor_description":"Wile E. Coyote (also known simply as \\\"The Coyote\\\") and The Road Runner are a duo of cartoon characters from a series of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons. The characters (a coyote and Greater Roadrunner) were created by animation director Chuck Jones in 1948 for Warner Bros., while the template for their adventures was the work of writer Michael Maltese. The characters star in a long-running series of theatrical cartoon shorts (the first 16 of which were written by Maltese) and occasional made-for-television cartoons."},"3":{"instructor_name":"Riddick","instructor_description":"Richard B. Riddick (played by Vin Diesel), more commonly known simply as Riddick, is the antihero of three films in the Riddick series, namely Pitch Black, the animated movie The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury, and The Chronicles of Riddick; as well as the two video games The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay and The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena.\r\n\r\nWithin the canon of the series, he is shown to be a highly erratic and unstable individual - he is an extremely violent and dangerous convict, murderer and notorious sociopath, with other characters even going so far as to directly describe him as evil - yet despite this, he is sometimes shown to perform moral or even atypically heroic actions, usually against his better judgement."},"4":{"instructor_name":"Jacques Clouseau","instructor_description":"Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (formerly Inspector) is a fictional character in Blake Edwards\\' The Pink Panther series. In most of the films, he was played by Peter Sellers, with one film in which he was played by Alan Arkin and one in which he was played by an uncredited Roger Moore. In the 2006 Pink Panther revival and its 2009 sequel, he is played by Steve Martin.\r\n\r\nHe is also the inspiration of The Inspector, the main character in a series of short animated cartoons inspired by the titles of the feature films. Though the Inspector in the animated late 1960s series was never given a name, he is clearly based on Clouseau. However, more recent animated depictions of Chief Inspector Clouseau since the 1970s on were redesigned to resemble Sellers, and later Martin, more closely."},"5":{"instructor_name":"Sinead O\\'connor","instructor_description":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
